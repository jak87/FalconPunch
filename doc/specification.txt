	2) In a position to be immune to tagging (leaving jail, in friendly territory)
	3) Unique player ID
	4) Holding flag
Player Actions
	1) Move (and direction)
		a) Moving controls other corollary actions i.e. tagging a player by moving into their square, and picking up the flag
Win Conditions
	Scoring a point occurs when you return the enemy flag across the midpoint into friendly territory. There are three win conditions:
	1) Be first team to reach three points
	2) Have more points than the other team after 10 minute time limit
	3) Have all enemy players in jail
If the time limit is reached and teams have an equal score, the game ends in a draw.
Other Game Semantics
	1) Flags spawn in the team owner’s home territory.
	2) Flags immediately return to home territory if the carrying player is tagged
	3) To prevent game-breaking flag defense, players staying within a 10 cell radius of their home for more than 15 seconds will be teleported to jail
	4) Any tagged player is teleported to jail
	5) If a player moves into enemy jail, all players inside are freed. Players returning from jail are immune to being tagged, but will be teleported back to jail if they don’t return to their territory within 30 seconds.
